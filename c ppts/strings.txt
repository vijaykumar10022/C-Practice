				String
				------
-->C Strings are nothing but array of characters ended with null character (‘\0’).
-->This null character indicates the end of the string.
-->Strings are always enclosed by double quotes. Whereas, character is enclosed by single quotes in C
EXAMPLE FOR C STRING:
char string[20] = {'v','i','j','a','y', ‘\0’};
(or)
char string[20] = “vijay”;
(or)
char string []    = “vijay”;
-->Difference between above declarations are, when we declare char as “string[20]”, 20 bytes of memory space is allocated for holding the string value.
-->When we declare char as “string[]”, memory space will be allocated as per the requirement during execution of the program.
