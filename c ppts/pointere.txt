				Pointers
				--------
-->Pointer is a variable that stores/points the address of another variable
-->A Pointer in C is used to allocate memory dynamically i.e. at run time.
-->The pointer variable might be belonging to any of the data type such as int, float, char, double, short etc.

Syntax:
------
	data_type * var_name;
	Example : int *p;
Where, * is used to denote that “p” is pointer variable and not a normal variable.


Some key points of pointers:
---------------------------
-->Normal variable stores the value whereas pointer variable stores the address of the variable.
	int a=10
	int *ptr=&a;
-->The content of the C pointer always be a whole number i.e. address.
-->Always C pointer is initialized to null, i.e. int *p = null.
-->The value of null pointer is 0.
-->& symbol is used to get the address of the variable.
-->* symbol is used to get the value of the variable that the pointer is pointing to.
-->If a pointer in C is assigned to NULL, it means it is pointing to nothing.
